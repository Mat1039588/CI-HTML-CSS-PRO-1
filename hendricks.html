            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This "most unusual gin" has been brilliantly marketed as a quintessentially British product, associated with cucumber sandwiches and rose garden, whilst simultaneously being proudly Scottish in its origins. Created in Scotland in 1999, Hendrick's was successfully launched in the US in 2000, followed by the UK a few years later in 2003. It may be favoured with rose and cucumber, but it contains eleven more botanicals plus such pure water from the Penwhapple reservoir, high in the hills behind the distillery. This water is so pure that it is not purified or treated, merely filtered to remove sand. At the end of the distillation process, essence of Bulgarian Damascena rose petals and Dutch cucumber are added. The rose petals are pressed to release the oil, which is then dissolved with alcohol to produce the essence. Cucumbers are smashed up in water and the flavours are extracted around zero degrees Celsius using a cold distillation process.</p>
