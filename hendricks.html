            <h3>Description</h3>
           <br> <p>This "most unusual gin" has been brilliantly marketed as a quintessentially British product,<br>associated with cucumber sandwiches and rose garden, whilst simultaneously being proudly Scottish in its origins. <br>Created in Scotland in 1999, Hendrick's was successfully launched in the US in 2000, followed by the UK a few years later in 2003. <br>It may be favoured with rose and cucumber, but it contains eleven more botanicals plus such pure water from<br> the Penwhapple reservoir, high in the hills behind the distillery. This water is so pure that it is not purified or treated,<br> merely filtered to remove sand. At the end of the distillation process, essence of Bulgarian Damascena rose petals and <br>Dutch cucumber are added. The rose petals are pressed to release the oil, which is then dissolved with alcohol<br> to produce the essence.<br> Cucumbers are smashed up in water and the flavours are extracted around zero degrees Celsius using a cold distillation process.</p>
