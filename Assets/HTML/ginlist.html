            <h3>Description:</h3> 
            <p>Tanqueray no10 Gin was launched in 2000. It was named 10 because it was developed on the experimental still named 'Tiny 10'.<br> Tanqueray no10 features only eight botanicals. This gin may not have been possible in 1830 when Charles Tanqueray first developed <br>the recipe fir his gin. Fresh citrus, especially in the reliable qualities to make gin like this would have been quite expensive or just <br>simply not available in 19th century London on a predictable basis. <br>The whole citrus is distilled separately from the other botanicals. The two distillates are blended, diluted and bottled.

        <h3>Description</h3> <br>
        <p>A long standing favourite topple, this gin was one of the few gins to have a geographic indication, <br>obviously pertaining to its eponymous city. However, this gin lost its indication in 2015. <br>This is still a unique product, crafted from several botanicals in pot still with rather short neck and is blended with <br>Dartmoor water. It is then bottled into the classic "shaving bottle", with its distinctive green glass.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
       <br> <p>This "most unusual gin" has been brilliantly marketed as a quintessentially British product,<br>associated with cucumber sandwiches and rose garden, whilst simultaneously being proudly Scottish in its origins. <br>Created in Scotland in 1999, Hendrick's was successfully launched in the US in 2000, followed by the UK a few years later in 2003. <br>It may be favoured with rose and cucumber, but it contains eleven more botanicals plus such pure water from<br> the Penwhapple reservoir, high in the hills behind the distillery. This water is so pure that it is not purified or treated,<br> merely filtered to remove sand. At the end of the distillation process, essence of Bulgarian Damascena rose petals and <br>Dutch cucumber are added. The rose petals are pressed to release the oil, which is then dissolved with alcohol<br> to produce the essence.<br> Cucumbers are smashed up in water and the flavours are extracted around zero degrees Celsius using a cold distillation process.</p>
