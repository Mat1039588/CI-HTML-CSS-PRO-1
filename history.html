                <h1>WHAT IS GIN? AND WHAT IS IT MADE FROM?</h1><br>
                <p>Gin is a distilled spirit that is made from grain <br>and flavored with botanicals.<br> It is most noted for its pine flavor due to its main ingredient, juniper berries. <br>There are a variety of styles, from the famous<br> London dry gins to modern gins <br> that are less piney and more approachable.<br> Gin is a Dutch creation and the English made it popular worldwide. <br>Today, it's made and enjoyed throughout the world; Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the U.K. consume the most gin.<br> It's the main ingredient in a classic martini and vital to the iconic gin and tonic, <br>but there are many great cocktail recipes that show off the botanical spirit. <br><br>Gin was created by Dr. Franciscus Sylvus, a Dutch chemist, during the 16th century. <br>His original intention was to make an elixir that would cleanse the blood of those suffering from kidney disorders.<br> Sylvus named his creation geni√®vre, French for "juniper." <br>Mass production in England soon followed after King William III banned expensive liquor imports from France due to a <br>grudge and made gin affordable for the masses. Since that time, gin has spread to a worldwide following. </p>
